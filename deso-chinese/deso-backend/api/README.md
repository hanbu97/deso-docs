## ProfileEntryResponse

Every public key on the DeSo blockchain can have a profile that describes who they are.

The API returns profiles in the form of an object referred to as a ProfileEntryResponse.

Below is an example of a ProfileEntryResponse with explanations about each attributes.

```json5
{
  "PublicKeyBase58Check": "tBCKW665XZnvVZcCfcEmyeecSZGKAdaxwV2SH9UFab6PpSRikg4EJ2", // Public key
  "Username": "test", // Username of the public key
  "Description": "this is an example description", // Description displayed on the user's profile
  "IsHidden": false, // Deprecated - ignore.
  "IsReserved": false, // If IsReserved is true, this is a reserved prole that can be claimed by tweeting out a link.
  "IsVerified": false, // If IsVerified is true, this profile is verified on the node on which you are querying and will appear with a blue checkmark
  "Comments": null, // Comments that have been made by this user. This is rarely populated.
  "Posts": null, // Posts that have been made by this user.
  "CoinEntry": {
    "CreatorBasisPoints": 10000, // Founder reward percentage in basis points. e.g. 10%. User will take 10% of all creator coin purchases.

  },

Unrestricted means you can transfer to anybody, profile_owner_only means you can only transfer TO or FROM this profile's public key, dao_members_only means you can only transfer to user's who already hold this DAO coin, and permanently_unrestricted means there are no restrictions and this status will never be updated again.
  },

Objects of this type will be denoted as `<ProfileEntryResponse>` in this documentation.

For reference, `ProfileEntryResponse` is defined in the backend repo [here](https://github.com/deso-protocol/backend/blob/036804dc7c182305ceb8172cbb92598dcbd4d102/routes/user.go#L577).

## PostEntryResponse

Posts are the main way creators communicate with the public on DeSo.\
\

## BalanceEntryResponse

`BalanceEntryResponses` are another common object you will encounter. \
\
`BalanceEntryResponses` describe the amount of a specific creator coin or DAO coin that a user holds.

```json5
{
  "HODLerPublicKeyBase58Check": "tBCKVERmG9nZpHTk2AVPqknWc1Mw9HHAnqrTpW1RnXpXMQ4PsQgnmV", // Public key of user who is holding this creator's coin or the DAO coin.

  "HasPurchased": false, // If true, this user has purchased some amount of creator coins of this creator. If false, they have received these creator coins in a transfer. This field is always false for DAO coins.
  "BalanceNanos": 1000000000, // How many nanos of this creator's coin does the HODLer own. This field is used for creator coins as DAO coins can exceed the max uint64 value.
  "BalanceNanosUint256": "0x3B9ACA00", // Balance Nanos as a hex string. This is used for DAO coins.
  "NetBalanceInMempool": 0, // How many nanos of this creator's coin or DAO coin does this HODLer own that are still waiting to be mined into a block.

## NFTEntryResponse

`NFTEntryResponses` summarize the current state of a single serial number (copy) of an NFT.

```json5

  "MinBidAmountNanos": 0, // Minimum bid amount in nanos allowed on this serial number.
  "IsBuyNow": true, // If true, this serial number can be purchased at the price of BuyNowPriceNanos without requiring an accept nft bid transaction from the owner.
  "BuyNowPriceNanos": 100000000000, // This is the price at which this serial number can be "bought now". A user can "Buy Now" by submitting a bid that matches the buy now price nanos.
  "LastAcceptedBidAmountNanos": 10000000, // Bid amount in nanos representing the last price at which this serial number was sold.
  "HighestBidAmountNanos": 1150000000, // Highest bid amount currently on this serial number.

## NFTCollectionResponse

`NFTCollectionResponses` provide a high-level overview of the current state of an NFT and all its serial numbers.

```json5
{
  "ProfileEntryResponse": <ProfileEntryResponse>, // ProfileEntryResponse of the creator of the NFT
  "PostEntryResponse": <PostEntryResponse>, // PostEntryResponse of the post that is an NFT
  "HighestBidAmountNanos": 2000000000, // Highest bid amount currently on any serial number of this Post
