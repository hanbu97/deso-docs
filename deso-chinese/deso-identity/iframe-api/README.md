# 2âƒ£ Identity: iFrame API

## Introduction

This guide describes the iframe API, which is an essential component of integrating with the DeSo Identity Service for web application developers.

If you haven't yet read through the [identity](../identity/ "mention") and [concepts.md](../identity/concepts.md "mention") guides, it would be helpful to do so prior to reading this documentation.

This guide also depends on [window-api](../window-api/ "mention"), so we recommend reading about it first.

The iframe API guide consists of two subpages, which should give you a comprehensive view of the API:

* [basics.md](basics.md "mention") guide outlines the fundamentals of integrating with the iframe API
* [endpoints.md](endpoints.md "mention") is an exhaustive list of all API endpoints.

If you're creating a mobile app, check out our [mobile-integration.md](../identity/mobile-integration.md "mention") guide next.
